# GameOfLife_Py

### Black is considered as empty box and yellow is considered as neighbour
### Initially Black and Yellow buttons are randomly generated

## The Rules

### For a space that is 'populated':
### Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
### Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
### Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
### For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
### Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
